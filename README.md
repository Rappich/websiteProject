# Website Project - Work in Progress ðŸš€  

## Overview  

Welcome to my personal **resume and company website**! My name is **Fredrik Rappich**, a former **HR professional** transitioning into **IT development**, specializing in **C/C++ programming**.  

I started this project with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to build a solid foundation in web development. As I progress, Iâ€™m integrating **React, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript** to create a modern, scalable web application.  

This project serves as both:  
âœ… A personal **resume website**  
âœ… A showcase for **Rappich Consulting AB**, my consulting business in **HR & IT**
