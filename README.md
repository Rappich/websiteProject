# Personal Portfolio Website

## Overview

This is my personal **portfolio website**, built to showcase my background, skills, and projects as I transition from HR to system development.

The project started with a static website built in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to establish a strong foundation. I later refactored it into a modern web application using **React**, **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS** — to deepen my understanding of current web development practices.

While the original plan included building a company site for **Rappich Consulting AB**, that will now be developed separately in another project.

## Purpose

This project serves two main purposes:

- A **learning platform** to build practical experience with modern web development tools and workflows.
- A **professional portfolio site** that I actively share with recruiters and collaborators.

It reflects both my technical progress and my personal journey — and acts as a central place to view my experience, contact info, and selected projects.
