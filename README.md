# Website Project

## Overview

Welcome to my personal Resume and Company website! My name is **Fredrik Rappich**, and I’m a former HR professional transitioning into the IT field. While my primary focus is on C/C++ development, this project is part of my journey to learn web development and deployment.

## Learning Journey

I am starting by building this website using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to gain a solid foundation in front-end web development. Once I have familiarized myself with these technologies, I plan to recreate the project using **React** and **Node.js** to deepen my understanding of modern web development frameworks.

## Purpose

This site serves as both a personal resume and a showcase for **Rappich Consulting AB**, the company I run part-time while learning system development. The company offers consulting services in **HR** and **IT development**. Through this project, I aim to:

- Develop my skills in front-end and back-end web technologies.
- Learn how to build and deploy websites effectively.
- Establish a professional online presence.

## Website Features

The website includes the following sections:

- **About Me**
- **Skills**
- **Projects**
- **Experience**
- **Education**
- **Contact**
- **Company Page**: Showcasing **Rappich Consulting AB**, with details about our HR and IT consulting services.

## Future Plans

Once I have completed the initial version of the site, I will move on to:

- Rebuilding it with **React** (for the front end) and **Node.js** (for the back end).
- Implementing a more dynamic and interactive user experience.
- Exploring hosting, databases, and authentication for a full-stack application.
